Interacting with the API
=========================

Overview
----------

``counterpartyd`` features a full-fledged JSON RPC-based API (not yet!), which allows third-party applications to perform
functions on the Counterparty network without having to deal with the low-level details of transaction encoding,
state management, and so on.

The ``counterpartyd`` API works similar to ``bitcoind``'s JSON RPC API interface. `This page <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)>`__
contains examples of interacting with the ``bitcoind`` API in a variety of programming languages. The basic
dynamics are similar when interacting with ``counterpartyd``.

Also, please see the scripts in the ``examples`` subdirectory.
