Interacting with the API
=========================

Overview
----------

``counterpartyd`` features a full-fledges JSON RPC-based API, which allows 3rd party applications to perform
functions on the CounterParty network without having to deal with the low level details of transaction encoding,
state management, and so on.

The ``counterpartyd`` API works similar to ``bitcoind``'s JSON RPC API interface. `This page <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_(JSON-RPC)>`__
contains examples of interacting with the ``bitcoind`` API in a variety of programming languages. The basic
dynamics are similar when interacting with ``counterpartyd``.

Also, please see the scripts in the ``examples`` subdirectory.
